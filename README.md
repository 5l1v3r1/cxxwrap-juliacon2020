Tutorial files for the JuliaCon 2020 CxxWrap workshop (should it be accepted)

This repository will host the tutorial files for a proposed JuliaCon 2020 workshop on [CxxWrap.jl](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/CxxWrap.jl).

## Prerequisites

Aside from a working Julia 1.3 installation, a C++17 compiler is also needed to follow along the tutorial:
* Linux: Install the packages containing g++ and CMake
* macOS: Run `xcode-select --install` and install CMake from: https://cmake.org/download/
* Windows: Install Visual Studio Community edition from https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/ and make sure to activate the "Desktop development with C++" workload, with CMake activated.
